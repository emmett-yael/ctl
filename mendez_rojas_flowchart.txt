This flowchart is intended to guide those helping asylum seekers determine if the asylum seeker is a member of the Mendez Rojas class, which would give them a legal recourse for missing the required one-year deadline for application by asylum seekers. </p>

</p>The questions are framed in order to minimize legalese and make the technical terms accessible to the client.</p>
