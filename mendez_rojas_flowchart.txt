This flowchart is intended to guide those helping asylum seekers (or asylum seekers working on their own case) to determine if the asylum seeker is a member of the Mendez Rojas class, which would give them a legal recourse for not filing for asylum (the i-589 form) within the required one-year deadline.</p>
</b>
</p>The questions are framed in order to minimize legalese and make the technical terms accessible to the client.</p>
